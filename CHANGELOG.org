- Major refactor: renamed model to experiment.
- Functions to track and copy files imported by the experiment scripts.
- All files imported by an experiment script and the experiment script itself will be copied to the `experiment_dir` directory
- Removed the use_history feature for now.
  - It seems to be buggy.
- [[https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow][Mlflow]] integration.
  - If mlflow exists and use_mlflow is not set to `False`:
    - All mlflow related data will be stored in the outputs/mlrun directory
    - Each experiment script is considered a mlflow-experiment.
    - Each version executed form the experiment is considered a mlflow-run of the respective experiment.
    - The Matric.log_matrics will log all the metrics to mlflow also.
    - All the parameters passed through the version will be logged as parameters by mlflow.
